    "# Contextual Semantic Search with Chroma and LiteLLM\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a **Contextual Semantic Search** system using **Chroma Vector Database** and **LiteLLM** with the **Gemini model**. The system processes a folder of PDF documents, builds a knowledge base, and retrieves contextually relevant information to answer user queries. Below is an overview of the tools and methods used.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools Used\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chroma Vector Database**:\n",
    "   - A vector database designed for storing and querying embeddings.\n",
    "   - Enables efficient similarity search for retrieving semantically relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sentence Transformers**:\n",
    "   - A library for generating high-quality embeddings (vector representations) of text.\n",
    "   - Uses pre-trained models like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to convert text into embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LangChain**:\n",
    "   - A framework for working with text data, including text splitting and chunking.\n",
    "   - The `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` is used to split text into semantically meaningful chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **LiteLLM**:\n",
    "   - A lightweight library for interacting with large language models (LLMs).\n",
    "   - Used here to call the **Gemini model** for generating responses based on retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **PyPDF2**:\n",
    "   - A library for extracting text from PDF files.\n",
    "   - Used to process all PDFs in a specified folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods and Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Extract Text from PDFs\n",
    "- All PDF files in a specified folder are processed using **PyPDF2**.\n",
    "- The text from each PDF is extracted and combined into a single string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Split Text into Chunks\n",
    "- The combined text is split into smaller chunks using **LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**.\n",
    "- This ensures that the chunks are semantically meaningful and retain context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Generate Embeddings\n",
    "- Each text chunk is converted into an embedding (vector representation) using **Sentence Transformers**.\n",
    "- The embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Build the Knowledge Base\n",
    "- The embeddings and corresponding text chunks are stored in **Chroma Vector Database**.\n",
    "- This allows for efficient similarity searches based on semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Perform Semantic Search\n",
    "- A user query is converted into an embedding.\n",
    "- The most semantically similar chunks are retrieved from the Chroma database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Generate Responses\n",
    "- The retrieved chunks are passed as context to the **Gemini model** via **LiteLLM**.\n",
    "- The model generates a response based on the query and the provided context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input**: A folder containing PDF documents.\n",
    "2. **Processing**:\n",
    "   - Extract text from PDFs.\n",
    "   - Split text into chunks.\n",
    "   - Generate embeddings and store them in Chroma.\n",
    "3. **Query Handling**:\n",
    "   - Convert the query into an embedding.\n",
    "   - Retrieve the most relevant chunks from Chroma.\n",
    "   - Generate a response using the Gemini model.\n",
    "4. **Output**: A contextually accurate answer to the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contextual Semantic Search**: Goes beyond keyword matching to understand the meaning and context of the query.\n",
    "- **Efficient Retrieval**: Chroma enables fast and scalable similarity searches.\n",
    "- **High-Quality Responses**: The Gemini model generates accurate and contextually relevant answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s get started! You can see the full workflow in the diagram below."
