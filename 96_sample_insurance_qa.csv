0,"The insurance industry safeguards the assets of its policyholders by transferring risk from an individual or business to an insurance company. Insurance companies act as financial intermediaries in that they invest the premiums they collect for providing this service. Insurance company size is usually measured by net premiums written, that is, premium revenues less amounts paid for reinsurance. There are three main insurance sectors: property/casualty, life/health and health insurance. Property/casualty (P/C) consists mainly of auto, home and commercial insurance. Life/health (L/H) consists mainly of life insurance and annuity products. Health insurance is offered by private health insurance companies and some L/H and P/C insurers, as well as by government programs such as Medicare.","What are the three main sectors of the insurance industry, and what types of insurance are typically included in each sector?","The three main sectors are property/casualty (auto, home, commercial), life/health (life insurance, annuities), and health insurance (offered by private companies and government programs like Medicare).",Insurance_Handbook_20103
1,"As assumers of risk, insurers seek to mitigate potential losses every day through a process known as risk management. Since climate change could lead to losses on a scale never before experienced, insurers are not waiting for researchers to produce all the answers. A 2009 report by Ceres, a network of companies concerned about global warming, identified some 244 insurancerelated organizations in 29 countries that were working in 2008 to find solutions to the threat posed by greenhouse gas emissions, up from 190 groups in 26 countries in 2007. Insurers are also redoubling their efforts in the more traditional areas of risk management, including alerting policyholders to the potential for lawsuits for failure to protect against or disclose possible harm to the environment.",How are insurers responding to the financial risks posed by climate change?,"Insurers are actively managing climate change risks through risk management strategies, including collaborations to find solutions and increased efforts in traditional risk management areas, such as alerting policyholders to potential environmental lawsuits.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
2,"Some businesses involve services such as giving advice, making recommendations, designing things, providing physical care or representing the needs of others, which can lead to being sued by customers, clients or patients claiming that the business' failure to perform a job properly has injured them. Errors and omissions or professional liability insurance covers these situations. The policy will pay any judgment for which the insured is legally liable, up to the policy limit. It also provides legal defense costs, even when there has been no wrongdoing.","What types of situations does errors and omissions or professional liability insurance cover, and what does the policy typically provide?","It covers situations where businesses fail to perform a job properly, leading to lawsuits.  The policy pays judgments up to the limit and covers legal defense costs, even without wrongdoing.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
3,"According to an April 2009 Property Casualty Insurers of America (PCI) release, the recent economic downturn did not have the negative effect on credit scores that some people predicted. Major consumer credit reporting agencies such as Fair Isaac and TransUnion have reported that average scores remain steady or have improved, possibly because consumers are saving more and paying off debt. Despite the economy and credit crisis, no state has made regulatory changes to insurers' use of insurance scores, PCI notes.","What was the impact of the 2009 economic downturn on consumer credit scores, and how did this affect insurance regulation?","Contrary to some predictions, the 2009 economic downturn did not negatively affect credit scores; they remained steady or improved.  No state changed regulations regarding insurers' use of insurance scores.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
4,"With limited growth prospects in the insurance markets of developed countries, which are largely saturated, insurers see microinsurance in emerging economies as presenting significant potential for growth and profitability. A 2009 Swiss Re report on world insurance markets found that premium growth in emerging markets far outpaced growth in industrialized countries in 2008. The study identified the following regions as 'emerging markets': Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, South and East Asia, the Middle East (excluding Israel) and Central Asia, Turkey and Africa.","According to a 2009 Swiss Re report, which regions were identified as emerging markets with significant potential for microinsurance growth?","The report identified Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, South and East Asia, the Middle East (excluding Israel), Central Asia, Turkey, and Africa as emerging markets with significant potential for microinsurance growth.",Insurance_Handbook_20103

6,"Choices given to the owner or beneficiary of a life insurance policy regarding the method by which the insurer will pay the policy's proceeds when the policy owner does not receive the benefits in one single payment. Typically, the owner can elect (1) to leave the proceeds with the insurer and earn a specified interest rate, (2) to have the proceeds paid in a series of installments for a pre-selected period, (3) to have the proceeds paid in a pre-selected sum in a series of installments for as long as the proceeds last, or (4) to have the insurer tie payment of the proceeds to the life expectancy of a named individual through a life annuity. Also known as optional modes of settlement. ( See Life annuity)",What choices does a life insurance policy owner have regarding the payment of policy proceeds?,"The owner can choose to leave the proceeds with the insurer to earn interest, receive them in installments over a set period, receive a pre-selected sum in installments until the proceeds are gone, or receive payments tied to a named individual's life expectancy via a life annuity.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
7,"Reinsurance Facilities: Reinsurance facilities exist in North Carolina, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. (In Massachusetts, beginning in April 2008, the reinsurance facility which is known as Commonwealth Automobile Insurers, or CAR, began disbanding over a three-year period as the new 'managed competition' regulations take effect.) An automobile reinsurance facility is an unincorporated, nonprofit entity, through which auto insurers provide coverage and service claims. After issuing a policy, an insurer decides whether to handle the policy as part of its regular 'voluntary business' or transfer it to the reinsurance facility or pool. An insurer is permitted to transfer or 'cede' to the pool a percentage of its policies. Premiums for this portion of business are sent to the pool and companies bill the pool for claims payments and expenses. Profits or losses are shared by all auto insurers licensed in the state.","What is an automobile reinsurance facility, and how do insurers utilize it to manage risk?","It is an unincorporated, nonprofit entity where insurers can transfer a percentage of their policies.  Premiums are sent to the pool, and claims/expenses are billed to it; profits/losses are shared among insurers.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
8,"Any enterprise can be sued. Customers may claim that the business caused them harm as the result of, for example, a defective product, an error in a service or disregard for another person's property. Or a claimant may allege that the business created a hazardous environment. Liability insurance pays damages for which the business is found liable, up to the policy limits, as well as attorneys' fees and other legal defense expenses. It also pays the medical bills of any people injured by, or on the premises of, the business.","What are some common reasons a business might be sued, and what does liability insurance cover in such cases?","Businesses can be sued for defective products, errors in service, property damage, or creating hazardous environments.

9,ing a number to each catastrophe. Each claim arising from the event is tagged so that total industrywide losses can be tabulated. The term catastrophe is often used in the property insurance industry in a narrow way to mean a catastrophic event that exceeds a dollar threshold in claims payouts. This figure has changed over the years with inflation and the increase in development of areas subject to natural disasters. Starting in 1997 the catastrophe definition was raised from $5 million to $25 million in insured damage.,"What criteria does the property insurance industry use to define a catastrophe, and how has this definition changed over time?",The property insurance industry defines a catastrophe as a catastrophic event exceeding a dollar threshold in claims payouts.  This threshold was $5 million before 1997 and increased to $25 million afterwards due to inflation and increased development in disaster-prone areas.,Insurance_Handbook_20103
10,"Proposals for Change: The NFIP has four major goals: to decrease the risk of flood losses; reduce the costs and consequences of flooding; reduce the demand for federal assistance; and preserve and restore beneficial floodplain functions. In a final report published in 2006 by the American Institutes for Research (AIR), which conducted an evaluation of the federal flood insurance program, AIR said that although much had been accomplished, the program fell short of meeting its goals in part because the NFIP did not have the ability to guide development away from floodplains and cannot restore beneficial floodplain functions once they have been impaired. In addition, AIR said, many people still are not covered or not adequately covered for flood damage. AIR also noted that the NFIP was hampered in reaching its goals by insufficient Congressional funding, lack of pertinent data, misperceptions about the nature of the program and the breakdown in coordination among its three major sectors.","According to the 2006 AIR report, what were the main reasons why the NFIP fell short of its goals?","The NFIP's inability to guide development away from floodplains, failure to restore impaired floodplain functions, inadequate coverage for many people, insufficient Congressional funding, lack of data, misperceptions about the program, and poor coordination among its sectors.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
11,"Auto Insurance Initiatives: Motor vehicles account for more than 25 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Insurance policies such as pay-as-youdrive, which factors mileage driven into the price of insurance, and hybrid car discounts could reduce that amount by more than 10 percent if broadly implemented, according to Ceres, a network of companies concerned about global warming. A study by the Brookings Institution suggests that if drivers paid by the mile, driving would drop by about 8 percent.","What impact could insurance policies like pay-as-you-drive and hybrid car discounts have on greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles in the US, according to Ceres and the Brookings Institution?","According to Ceres, broad implementation of such policies could reduce emissions by more than 10 percent.

12,Insurers must preserve the fine line between investigating suspicious claims and harassing legitimate claimants and the need to comply with the time requirements for paying claims imposed by fair claim practice regulations. All states have unfair claim settlement practice laws on their books to ensure that the parties involved are informed of the progress of investigations and that investigators settle the claim promptly or within a specified amount of time. About 19 states have provisions that provide guidance and protection for investigators by allowing time limit extensions or waivers and detailing what evidence is required and to whom the evidence should be made available.,"What is the challenge faced by insurers regarding claim investigations, and what legal measures are in place to address this?","Insurers must balance investigating suspicious claims without harassing legitimate claimants, while adhering to timely claim settlement laws.  State laws ensure transparency and prompt claim settlement, with some states offering investigators protection through time extensions or waivers and defining evidence requirements.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
13,"·  Homeowners Policy Endorsement: Homeowners may be able to add a simple endorsement or rider to their existing homeowners policy to increase coverage.
·  In-Home Business Policy: An in-home business policy provides more comprehensive coverage for business equipment and liability than a homeowners policy endorsement. Many insurance companies offer insurance policies specifically tailored to small business.
·  Businessowners Policy (BOP): The home business might be eligible for The Businessowners Policy (BOP), see above. The key to whether a business owner is eligible for a BOP is the size of the premises, the limits of liability required, the type of commercial operation it is and the extent of its off-premises servicing and processing activities. A BOP, like an in-home business policy, covers business property and equipment, loss of income, extra expense and liability; however, the BOP provides these coverages on a much broader scale.","What are the three main types of insurance policies mentioned that can cover a home-based business, and what are their key differences?","The three main types are Homeowners Policy Endorsement (limited coverage, added to existing policy), In-Home Business Policy (more comprehensive than endorsement), and Businessowners Policy (BOP) (broadest coverage, eligibility depends on business size and activities).",Insurance_Handbook_20103
14,"Arbitration: To keep small disputes out of the courts, insurers are increasingly turning to arbitration. The nation's largest arbitration provider, nonprofit Arbitration Forums, resolved more than 520,000 inter-insurance disputes in 2009 valued at $2.5 billion, for a savings in litigation costs of $700 million. Disputes leading to arbitration typically arise when insurance or self-insured companies believe their policyholders or employees are not at fault or due to disagreement over the percentage of liability or the amount of damages. More than 85 percent of these disputes involve auto collisions.","How many inter-insurance disputes did Arbitration Forums resolve in 2009, and what was the estimated savings in litigation costs?","Arbitration Forums resolved more than 520,000 disputes in 2009, resulting in $700 million in savings on litigation costs.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
15,"The Insurance Cycle: The property/casualty insurance industry has exhibited cyclical behavior for many years, as far back as the 1920s. These cycles are characterized by periods of rising rates leading to increased profitability. Following a period of solid but not spectacular rates of return, the industry enters a down phase where prices soften, supply of insurance becomes plentiful and, eventually, profitability diminishes or vanishes completely. In the cycle's down phase, as results deteriorate, the basic ability of insurance companies to underwrite new business or, for some companies even to renew some existing policies, can be impaired because the capital needed to support the underwriting of risk has been depleted through losses. Cycles vary in their severity.","What are the characteristics of the property/casualty insurance industry's cyclical behavior, and what happens during the down phase?","The cycles are characterized by rising rates and increased profitability, followed by a down phase with softening prices, plentiful supply, and diminished profitability.  In the down phase, underwriting ability can be impaired due to depleted capital from losses.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
16,"A form of insurance that covers a policyholder's belongings against perils such as fire, theft, windstorm, hail, explosion, vandalism, riots, and others. It also provides personal liability coverage for damage the policyholder or dependents cause to third parties. It also provides additional living expenses, known as loss-of-use coverage, if a policyholder must move while his or her dwelling is repaired. It also can include coverage for property improvements. Possessions can be covered for their replacement cost or for their actual cash value, which includes depreciation.","What perils are typically covered by homeowner's insurance, and what additional types of coverage might it offer?","Homeowner's insurance typically covers perils such as fire, theft, windstorm, hail, explosion, vandalism, and riots.

Among the major coverages are boiler and machinery, business income, commercial auto, comprehensive general liability, directors and officers liability, fire and allied lines, inland marine, medical malpractice liability, product liability, professional liability, surety and fidelity, and workers compensation. Most of these commercial coverages can be purchased separately except business income, which must be added to a fire insurance (property) policy. ( See Commercial multiple peril policy)","What types of insurance coverages are commonly included in commercial insurance policies, and which coverage cannot be purchased separately?","Major commercial coverages include boiler and machinery, business income, commercial auto, general liability, and more. Business income must be added to a fire insurance policy.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
18,"Other limited replacement income is available for workers under some circumstances from workers compensation (if the injury or illness is job-related), auto insurance (if disability results from an auto accident) and the Department of Veterans Affairs. For most workers, even those with some employer-paid coverage, an individual disability income policy is the best way to ensure adequate income in the event of disability. Workers who buy a private disability income policy can expect to replace from 50 percent to 70 percent of income. Disability benefits paid out on individual disability policies are not taxed; benefits from employer-paid policies are subject to income tax.","What are some alternative sources of replacement income for disabled workers, and what is the typical income replacement percentage offered by private disability income policies?","Alternative sources include workers' compensation, auto insurance, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Private disability income policies typically replace 50-70% of income, and benefits are not taxed.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
19,"Flood damage is excluded under standard homeowners and renters insurance policies. Flood coverage, however, is available in the form of a separate policy both from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and from a few private insurers. Additional information on flood insurance can be found on the FloodSmart.gov Web site or by calling 888-379-9531. For coverage over and above the $250,000 limit for property and $100,000 for contents provided by the NFIP, excess flood insurance is available from private insurance companies. (See Topic on Flood Insurance on page 47 for further information.)","What is the coverage limit for property and contents under the NFIP, and where can additional flood insurance be obtained?","The NFIP provides up to $250,000 for property and $100,000 for contents.

20,"·  Variable Life: Variable life policies combine death protection with a savings account that can be invested in stocks, bonds and money market mutual funds. The value of the policy may grow more quickly, but involves more risk. If investments do not perform well, the cash value and death benefit may decrease. Some policies, however, guarantee that the death benefit will not fall below a minimum level.
·  Variable Universal Life: This type of policy combines the features of variable and universal life policies, including the investment risks and rewards characteristic of variable life insurance and the ability to adjust premiums and the death benefit that is characteristic of universal life insurance.",What are the key differences between variable life and variable universal life insurance policies?,"Variable life combines death protection with investments in stocks, bonds, etc., with potential for higher growth but also risk of decreased cash value and death benefit. Variable universal life adds the flexibility to adjust premiums and death benefits.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
21,"The insurance business is based on the spread of risk. The more widely risk is spread, the more accurately loss can be estimated. An insurance company can more accurately estimate the probability of loss on 100,000 homes than on ten. Years ago, insurers were required to use standardized forms and rates developed by rating agencies. Today, large insurers use their own statistical loss data to develop rates. But small insurers, or insurers focusing on special lines of business, with insufficiently broad loss data to make them actuarially reliable depend on pooled industry data collected by such organizations as ISO, which provides information to help develop rates such as estimates of future losses and loss adjustment expenses like legal defense costs.","How do insurance companies estimate losses, and why is data pooling important for smaller insurers?","Larger insurers use their own statistical loss data. Smaller insurers rely on pooled industry data from organizations like ISO for actuarially reliable rate development, including estimates of future losses and loss adjustment expenses.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
22,"In a similar study, the FTC found that auto insurers' use of insurance credit scores leads to more accurate underwriting of auto insurance policies in that there is a correlation between insurance scores and the likelihood of filing an insurance claim. The FTC report, Credit-Based Insurance Scores: Impacts on Consumers of Automobile Insurance, released in July 2007, also states that credit scores cannot easily be used as a proxy for race and ethnic origin. In other words, credit scoring predicted risk for members of minority groups in much the same way that it predicted risk for members of nonminority groups.","What did the FTC find regarding the use of insurance credit scores in auto insurance underwriting, and what did their 2007 report conclude about the use of credit scores as a proxy for race and ethnicity?","The FTC found that using insurance credit scores leads to more accurate underwriting because of a correlation between scores and claim likelihood.  Their 2007 report stated credit scores are not easily used as a proxy for race and ethnicity, predicting risk similarly across minority and non-minority groups.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
23,"Insurance scores are confidential rankings based on credit information. This includes whether the consumer has made timely payments on loans, the number of open credit card accounts and whether a bankruptcy filing has been made. An insurance score is a measure of how well consumers manage their financial affairs, not of their financial assets. It does not include information about income or race.

24,"The field has gradually evolved to the point where some investors and insurance company issuers are beginning to feel comfortable with the concept, with some coming back to the capital markets each year. In addition to the high interest rates catastrophe bonds pay, their attraction to investors is that they diversify investment portfolio risk, thus reducing the volatility of returns. The returns on most other securities are tied to economic activity rather than natural disasters. Catastrophe bonds have evolved into a multibillion dollar industry. Though pioneered by reinsurers, primary insurers now frequently sponsor new issues.",Why are catastrophe bonds attractive to investors despite the risks involved?,"Catastrophe bonds offer high interest rates and diversify investment portfolio risk, reducing volatility of returns unlike other securities tied to economic activity.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
25,"A growing number of insurers are tapping into markets in developing countries through microinsurance projects, which provide low-cost insurance to individuals generally not covered by traditional insurance or government programs. Microinsurance products tend to be much less costly than traditional products and thus extend protection to a much wider market. The approach is an outgrowth of the microfinancing projects developed by Bangladeshi Nobel Prizewinning banker and economist Muhammad Yunus, which helped millions of low-income individuals in Asia and Africa to set up businesses and buy houses. American International Group Inc. (AIG) was one of the first companies to offer microinsurance and began selling policies in Uganda in 1997. Swiss Re, Munich Re, Allianz and Zurich Financial Services have also entered the microinsurance arena. Disasters such as the 2005 tsunami in Indonesia and the 2010 Haiti earthquake have demonstrated the need for insurance in many regions, prompting insurers to develop new products. While the coverage is often geared to protection from natural disasters, there are also programs covering life/health risks as well.","What triggered the growth of microinsurance in developing countries, and which major insurance companies are involved?","The growth of microinsurance is driven by the need to cover low-income individuals not served by traditional methods, spurred by events like the 2005 tsunami and 2010 Haiti earthquake.  Major players include AIG, Swiss Re, Munich Re, Allianz, and Zurich Financial Services.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
26,"The reinsurance business is evolving. Traditionally, reinsurance transactions were between two insurance entities: the primary insurer that sold the original insurance policies and the reinsurer. Most still are. Primary insurers and reinsurers can share both the premiums and losses or reinsurers may assume the primary company's losses above a certain dollar limit in return for a fee. However, risks of various kinds, particularly of natural disasters, are now being sold by insurers and reinsurers to institutional investors in the form of catastrophe bonds and other alternative risk-spreading mechanisms. Increasingly, new products reflect a gradual blending of reinsurance and investment banking.","How is the reinsurance business evolving, and what new mechanisms are being used to spread risk?","The reinsurance business is evolving from traditional insurer-reinsurer transactions to include institutional investors through catastrophe bonds and other alternative risk-spreading mechanisms, blending reinsurance and investment banking.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
27,"Fortunately, insurance companies run their businesses conservatively, as if every day might bring some new disaster, so despite current economic and financial conditions, the industry has been able to function normally. Unlike banks, insurers are not highly leveraged (they generally do not borrow to make investments or to pay claims); they limit the amount of risk they assume to the capital they have on hand; and because they do not sell the risks they assume to another party-they have some 'skin in the game'-they must underwrite carefully or suffer the consequences.","How do insurance companies mitigate financial risks, and why is this approach different from that of banks?","Insurance companies manage risk conservatively, limiting risk to available capital and maintaining a stake in the outcome, unlike highly leveraged banks.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
28,"Some insurers offer homeowners insurance policies that, in the event of a fire or other disaster, allow policyholders to rebuild to environmentally responsible 'green' standards, even if they had not purchased such a policy originally. Green standards, part of the sustainability movement, include energy conservation benchmarks and the use of renewable construction materials. The Green Building Council introduced its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification program in 2001. According to Ceres, buildings account for more than one-third of greenhouse gas emissions and green building practices can reduce energy use and emissions by more than 50 percent.","What percentage of greenhouse gas emissions do buildings account for, and how can green building practices reduce energy use and emissions?",Buildings account for more than one-third of greenhouse gas emissions.

29,"Disaster losses along the coast are likely to escalate in the coming years, in part because of huge increases in development. One catastrophe modeling company predicts that catastrophe losses will double every decade or so due to growing residential and commercial density and more expensive buildings. Data from the Census Bureau, collected by USA Today, show that in 2006, 34.9 million people were seriously threatened by Atlantic hurricanes, compared with 10.2 million in 1950. Before the 2005 hurricane season, Hurricane Andrew ranked as the single most costly U.S. natural disaster.",How are coastal development and population increases contributing to escalating disaster losses?,"Increased coastal development and population density lead to higher property values and greater potential losses from natural disasters, causing a doubling of catastrophe losses every decade.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
30,"In the past there was a clear delineation between coastal and urban plans with coastal properties insured under Beach and Windstorm Plans, and urban properties under FAIR Plans. Increasingly, the distinctions are blurring. FAIR Plans are acting as an insurer of last resort for residents who live in shoreline communities in states that do not have a Beach and Windstorm Plan, such as New York State. Beach and Windstorm Plans in some states are being merged with FAIR Plans or joint underwriting associations, as in Florida and Louisiana, or are administering new FAIR Plans, as in Texas. As a result, it is difficult to compare the number of properties insured under any Plan with numbers from earlier years. FAIR Plans have almost doubled in size, pushed up in large part by these mergers and the increase in coastal properties in such states as New York and Massachusetts, but also by more stringent underwriting standards on the part of insurers in the voluntary market.",What factors have contributed to the increase in size and complexity of FAIR Plans in recent years?,"The merging of FAIR Plans with Beach and Windstorm Plans in some states, an increase in coastal properties in states like New York and Massachusetts, and more stringent underwriting standards in the voluntary market have all contributed to the growth of FAIR Plans.",Insurance_Handbook_20103
31,"However, compensation levels are not uniform. In some states benefits are still inadequate, while in others, they are overly generous. Some states were slow in adopting the National Commission's guidelines and have still not embraced the entire package of 19 recommendations published in 1972. Many states exempt employers with only a few workers (fewer than five, four or three, depending on the state) from mandatory coverage laws. A major benefits issue still to be resolved in some states is the imbalance between levels of compensation for various degrees of impairment; permanent partial disabilities tend to be overcompensated and permanent total disability undercompensated.","What inconsistencies exist in workers' compensation across different states, and what are some unresolved issues?","Compensation varies widely; some states offer inadequate benefits, while others are overly generous.  Inconsistencies include slow adoption of 1972 recommendations, exemptions for small employers, and imbalanced compensation for different impairment levels (overcompensation for partial, undercompensation for total permanent disability).",Insurance_Handbook_20103

Commercial banks and other lenders have been securitizing mortgages for years, freeing up capital to expand their mortgage business. Insurers and reinsurers issue catastrophe bonds to the securities market through an issuer known as a special purpose reinsurance vehicle (SPRV) set up specifically for this purpose. These bonds have complicated structures and are typically created offshore where tax and regulatory treatment may be more favorable. SPRVs collect the premium from the insurance or reinsurance company and the principal from investors and hold them in a trust in the form of U.S. Treasuries or other highly rated assets, using the investment income to pay interest on the principal. Catastrophe bonds pay high interest rates but if the trigger event occurs, investors lose the interest and sometimes the principal, depending on the structure of the bond, both of which may be used to cover the insurer's disaster losses. Bonds may be issued for a one-year term or multiple years, often three.","How do catastrophe bonds work, and what are the risks and benefits for investors and insurers?","Catastrophe bonds transfer risk from insurers to investors.

Increasingly, they are using sophisticated modeling tools to assess this risk. According to the modeling firm, AIR Worldwide, the way terrorism risk is measured is not much different from assessments of natural disaster risk, except that the data used for terrorism are more subject to uncertainty. It is easier to project the risk of damage in a particular location from an earthquake of a given intensity or a Category 5 hurricane than a terrorist attack because insurers have had so much more experience with natural disasters than with terrorist attacks and therefore the data to incorporate into models are readily available.","How do insurance companies assess terrorism risk, and what are the challenges in this assessment compared to natural disaster risk assessment?","Insurance companies use sophisticated modeling tools to quantify the likelihood and potential damage of a terrorist event.

40,"The loss of a key person can be a major blow to a small business if that person is the founder of the business or is the key contact for customers and suppliers and the management of the business. Loss of the key person may also make the running of the business less efficient and result in a loss of capital. Losses caused by the death of a key employee are insurable. Such policies compensate the business against significant losses that result from that person's death or disability. The amount and cost of insurance needed for a particular business depends on the situation and the age, health and role of the key employee. Key employee life insurance pays a death benefit to the company when the key employee dies. The policy is normally owned by the company, which pays the premiums and is the beneficiary. The monies from key person insurance can be used to buy back shares in a company from the estate of the deceased, pay a head hunting firm to find a suitable replacement and cover costs or expenses while the business adjusts to the loss.",How can businesses mitigate the financial risks associated with the loss of a key employee?,"Businesses can mitigate these risks through key employee life insurance, which compensates for losses resulting from the death or disability of a key employee.

Flood insurance was initially only available through insurance agents who dealt directly with the federal program. The 'direct' policy program has been supplemented since 1983 with a private/public cooperative arrangement, known as 'Write Your Own,' through which a pool of insurance companies issue policies and adjust flood claims on behalf of the federal government under their own names, charging the same premium as the direct program. Participating insurers receive an expense allowance for policies written and claims processed. The federal government retains responsibility for underwriting losses. Today, most policies are issued through the Write-YourOwn program but some nonfederally backed coverage is available from the private market.","How does the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) function, and what are the roles of FEMA and private insurers?",The NFIP is administered by FEMA and offers flood insurance through two programs: a direct program and a Write Your Own (WYO) program.

Reinsurance effectively increases an insurer's capital and therefore its capacity to sell more coverage. The business is global and some of the largest reinsurers are based abroad. Reinsurers have their own reinsurers, called retrocessionaires. Reinsurers don't pay policyholder claims. Instead, they reimburse insurers for claims paid.

SAP, which evolved to enhance the industry's financial stability, is more conservative than the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), established by the independent Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly owned companies to report their financial results using GAAP rules. Insurers outside the United States use standards that differ from SAP and GAAP. As global markets developed, the need for more uniform accounting standards became clear. In 2001 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), an independent international accounting standards setting organization, began work on a set of standards, called International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that it hopes will be used around the world.

47,"Why Insurers Need It: Insurers need to be able to assess the risk of loss-the possibility that a driver or a homeowner will have an accident and file a claimin order to decide whether to insure that individual and what rate to set for the coverage provided. The more accurate the information, the closer the insurance company can come to making appropriate decisions. Where information is insufficient, applicants for insurance may be placed in the wrong risk classification. That means that some good drivers will pay more than they should for coverage and some bad drivers will pay less than they should. The insurance company will probably collect enough premiums between the two groups to pay claims and expenses, but the good drivers will be subsidizing the bad.","Why do insurers need accurate information when assessing risk, and what are the consequences of insufficient information?","Insurers need accurate information to assess risk and set appropriate insurance rates.

In the 1970s and 1980s, there were only two cycles, one mainly affecting auto insurance in the mid-1970s and the other in the mid-1980s, affecting commercial liability insurance. The commercial liability insurance cycle gave rise to the 'liability crisis,' when certain types of commercial liability coverages, such as insurance for daycare centers, municipalities, ski resorts and any establishment selling liquor, became difficult to obtain. Since that time, with the exception of the difficulty in obtaining medical malpractice insurance in the early part of the last decade, the insurance cycle has had less of an impact on the public.","How did the patterns of property/casualty insurance pricing cycles change between the 1950s-1960s and the 1970s-1980s, and what crisis emerged as a result?","In the 1950s-60s, insurance pricing followed regular three-year cycles of soft and hard pricing.

The cost per $1,000 of benefit increases as the insured person ages, and it obviously gets very high when the insured lives to 80 and beyond. The insurance company keeps the premium level by charging a premium that, in the early years, is higher than what is needed to pay claims, investing that money, and then using it to supplement the level premium to help pay the cost of life insurance for older people.",How do traditional whole life insurance policies maintain a level death benefit and premium throughout the policy's life?,"They charge a higher premium in the early years than needed, invest the excess, and use the investment returns to supplement premiums in later years when costs increase.",Insurance_Handbook_20103

In 2001 there were seven pools, but Florida's windstorm pool merged with the joint underwriting association in 2002 to create a new type of residual market entity, see below. In a similar move in 2003, Louisiana merged its FAIR Plan with its coastal pool. The Plans are mandatory in all of these states with the exception of Alabama. (In addition, hail and windstorm coverage for homes in coastal counties is available through some FAIR Plans, see above and the WindMap in New Jersey.) Windstorm Plans in Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas offer only wind and hail coverage. Plans in Alabama and North Carolina offer coverage for fire as well.

68,"Homeowners insurance provides financial protection against disasters. It is a package policy, which means that it covers both damage to property and liability, or legal responsibility, for any injuries and property damage policyholders or their families cause to other people. This includes damage caused by household pets. Damage caused by most disasters is covered but there are exceptions. Standard homeowners policies do not cover flooding, earthquakes or poor maintenance. Flood coverage, however, is available in the form of a separate policy both from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and from a few private insurers. Earthquake coverage is available either in the form of an endorsement or as a separate policy. Most maintenance-related problems are the homeowners' responsibility.","What are some common exclusions in standard homeowners insurance policies, and what alternative options exist for such coverage?","Standard policies exclude flood and earthquake damage, and usually don't cover damage from poor maintenance.

One is to encourage people to purchase vehicles that emit less carbon dioxide into the environment and get more miles per gallon of gasoline. A number of companies offer discounts to people who drive hybrid vehiclessome believe that people who are socially responsible are also more responsible behind the wheel. The other way is to reward people for driving fewer miles, known as pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) auto insurance. Several insurers have developed technology-based discount programs that provide financial incentives to drive fewer miles. Mileage information comes from a special device. In some, it is linked to the car's odometer and in others it is a wireless sensor that can monitor speed as well as mileage. These programs are offered in a growing number of states. In addition, California and several other states are encouraging the development of PAYD programs.","What are two methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from driving, and how do they work?",Two methods are encouraging low-emission vehicles and rewarding drivers for fewer miles driven (PAYD insurance).

70,"Reinsurance for catastrophic losses. The insurance industry is able to absorb the multibillion dollar losses caused by natural and man-made disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and terrorist attacks because losses are spread among thousands of companies including catastrophe reinsurers who operate on a global basis. Insurers' ability and willingness to sell insurance fluctuates with the availability and cost of catastrophe reinsurance. After major disasters, such as Hurricane Andrew and the World Trade Center terrorist attack, the availability of catastrophe reinsurance becomes extremely limited. Claims deplete reinsurers' capital and, as a result, companies are more selective in the type and amount of risks they assume. In addition, with available supply limited, prices for reinsurance rise. This contributes to an overall increase in prices for property insurance.","How does the availability and cost of catastrophe reinsurance affect insurers' ability and willingness to sell insurance, and what happens after major disasters?","Insurers' ability and willingness to sell insurance fluctuates with the availability and cost of catastrophe reinsurance. After major disasters, availability becomes limited, prices rise due to depleted reinsurer capital and increased selectivity, leading to higher property insurance prices.",Insurance_Handbook_20103

These applications are distributed randomly by the automobile insurance plan to all insurance companies that offer automobile liability coverage in the state in proportion to the amount of their voluntary business. Thus, if on a given day the plan receives 100 applications from agents around the state, a company with 10 percent of that state's regular private passenger automobile insurance business will be assigned 10 of those applicants and will be responsible for all associated losses.",How are auto insurance applications handled when agents cannot find coverage in the voluntary market?,"They're submitted to the assigned risk plan office, distributed proportionally among insurers based on their market share, and the assigned company is responsible for associated losses.",Insurance_Handbook_20103

The NCCI estimates that in 2008 employers' workers compensation insurance costs accounted for 1.7 percent of total compensation costs.   However, there is a wide variation in costs among states and industries, so that the highest rated (the inherent riskiest) groups could pay several hundred times that of the lowest rated (safest) groups, as a percentage of payroll.

73,"The move to modernize insurance regulation is being driven in part by the globalization of insurance services. Some large U.S. companies that operate in other countries support the concept of a federal system that provides one-stop regulatory approval while others believe the merits of a state system outweigh the virtues of a single national regulator. As a result of discussions about the merits of each system, states are making it easier for insurers to respond quickly to market forces. Since 2009, various pieces of legislation have been introduced in Congress that respond to a number of concerns: lack of an entity at the federal level that can represent insurance interests, particularly in the discussion of international issues; the need for better oversight of systemic risk-the interconnectedness of the risk assumed by a few large financial services companies whose failure could bring down the entire financial system; and the need to streamline the regulation of reinsurers and surplus lines insurers.",What are some of the arguments for and against a federal system of insurance regulation in the US?,"Arguments for a federal system include one-stop regulatory approval, facilitating responses to market forces.

Until then, the purchase of flood insurance had been voluntary, with only about one million policies in force. The 1973 amendment put constraints on the use of federal funds in high-risk floodplains, a measure that was expected to lead to almost universal flood coverage in these zones.

The Haiti quake killed over 220,000 people and caused $8 billion dollars in damages, most of it uninsured. The Chile quake, though more powerful, was far less deadly as its epicenter was located in a region with relatively low population density and because Chile's history of damaging quakes has led to strict building codes.
