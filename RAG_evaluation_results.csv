Reinsurance is insurance for insurance companies. It is a way of transferring 
or “ceding” some of the financial risk insurance companies assume in insur-ing cars, homes and businesses to another insurance company, the reinsurer.

Premiums, losses and expenses are shared among pool members in agreed-upon amounts. The range of activi-ties handled by the pool varies. Some pool operations are limited to redistrib-uting premiums and losses, while others have broader functions similar to an insurance company. Some pools use specific insurers as servicing carriers.","The context explains that insurance pools differ from some JUAs and assigned risk plans in that policyholders don't deal directly with an individual company; instead, premiums, losses, and expenses are shared among pool members.  The context also states that the range of activities handled varies, from simply redistributing premiums and losses to broader functions similar to an insurance company.  While this addresses the question's two parts, it lacks specifics on the precise differences between pools and JUAs/assigned risk plans beyond the sharing of premiums, losses, and expenses.
