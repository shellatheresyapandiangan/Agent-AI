"The insurance industry safeguards the assets of its policyholders by transferring risk from an individual or business to an insurance company. Insurance companies act as financial intermediaries in that they invest the premiums they collect for providing this service. Insurance company size is usually measured by net premiums written, that is, premium revenues less amounts paid for reinsurance. There are three main insurance sectors: property/casualty, life/health and health insurance. Property/casualty (P/C) consists mainly of auto, home and commercial insurance. Life/health (L/H) consists mainly of life insurance and annuity products. Health insurance is offered by private health insurance companies and some L/H and P/C insurers, as well as by government programs such as Medicare.","What are the three main sectors of the insurance industry, and what types of insurance are typically included in each sector?","The three main sectors are property/casualty (auto, home, commercial), life/health (life insurance, annuities), and health insurance (offered by private companies and government programs like Medicare).",Insurance_Handbook_20103,4.0,"The context clearly outlines the three main insurance sectors: property/casualty, life/health, and health.

"As assumers of risk, insurers seek to mitigate potential losses every day through a process known as risk management. Since climate change could lead to losses on a scale never before experienced, insurers are not waiting for researchers to produce all the answers. A 2009 report by Ceres, a network of companies concerned about global warming, identified some 244 insurancerelated organizations in 29 countries that were working in 2008 to find solutions to the threat posed by greenhouse gas emissions, up from 190 groups in 26 countries in 2007.

ing a number to each catastrophe. Each claim arising from the event is tagged so that total industrywide losses can be tabulated. The term catastrophe is often used in the property insurance industry in a narrow way to mean a catastrophic event that exceeds a dollar threshold in claims payouts.

"Proposals for Change: The NFIP has four major goals: to decrease the risk of flood losses; reduce the costs and consequences of flooding; reduce the demand for federal assistance; and preserve and restore beneficial floodplain functions. In a final report published in 2006 by the American Institutes for Research (AIR), which conducted an evaluation of the federal flood insurance program, AIR said that although much had been accomplished, the program fell short of meeting its goals in part because the NFIP did not have the ability to guide development away from floodplains and cannot restore beneficial floodplain functions once they have been impaired. In addition, AIR said, many people still are not covered or not adequately covered for flood damage. AIR also noted that the NFIP was hampered in reaching its goals by insufficient Congressional funding, lack of pertinent data, misperceptions about the nature of the program and the breakdown in coordination among its three major sectors.","According to the 2006 AIR report, what were the main reasons why the NFIP fell short of its goals?","The NFIP's inability to guide development away from floodplains, failure to restore impaired floodplain functions, inadequate coverage for many people, insufficient Congressional funding, lack of data, misperceptions about the program, and poor coordination among its sectors.",Insurance_Handbook_20103,5.0,"The context clearly states that the NFIP fell short of its goals due to inability to guide development away from floodplains, failure to restore impaired floodplain functions, inadequate coverage for many people, insufficient Congressional funding, lack of data, misperceptions about the program, and poor coordination among its sectors.

Insurers must preserve the fine line between investigating suspicious claims and harassing legitimate claimants and the need to comply with the time requirements for paying claims imposed by fair claim practice regulations. All states have unfair claim settlement practice laws on their books to ensure that the parties involved are informed of the progress of investigations and that investigators settle the claim promptly or within a specified amount of time.

"The Insurance Cycle: The property/casualty insurance industry has exhibited cyclical behavior for many years, as far back as the 1920s. These cycles are characterized by periods of rising rates leading to increased profitability. Following a period of solid but not spectacular rates of return, the industry enters a down phase where prices soften, supply of insurance becomes plentiful and, eventually, profitability diminishes or vanishes completely. In the cycle's down phase, as results deteriorate, the basic ability of insurance companies to underwrite new business or, for some companies even to renew some existing policies, can be impaired because the capital needed to support the underwriting of risk has been depleted through losses. Cycles vary in their severity.","What are the characteristics of the property/casualty insurance industry's cyclical behavior, and what happens during the down phase?","The cycles are characterized by rising rates and increased profitability, followed by a down phase with softening prices, plentiful supply, and diminished profitability.

"The insurance business is based on the spread of risk. The more widely risk is spread, the more accurately loss can be estimated. An insurance company can more accurately estimate the probability of loss on 100,000 homes than on ten. Years ago, insurers were required to use standardized forms and rates developed by rating agencies. Today, large insurers use their own statistical loss data to develop rates. But small insurers, or insurers focusing on special lines of business, with insufficiently broad loss data to make them actuarially reliable depend on pooled industry data collected by such organizations as ISO, which provides information to help develop rates such as estimates of future losses and loss adjustment expenses like legal defense costs.","How do insurance companies estimate losses, and why is data pooling important for smaller insurers?","Larger insurers use their own statistical loss data.

"The field has gradually evolved to the point where some investors and insurance company issuers are beginning to feel comfortable with the concept, with some coming back to the capital markets each year.

"A growing number of insurers are tapping into markets in developing countries through microinsurance projects, which provide low-cost insurance to individuals generally not covered by traditional insurance or government programs. Microinsurance products tend to be much less costly than traditional products and thus extend protection to a much wider market. The approach is an outgrowth of the microfinancing projects developed by Bangladeshi Nobel Prizewinning banker and economist Muhammad Yunus, which helped millions of low-income individuals in Asia and Africa to set up businesses and buy houses. American International Group Inc. (AIG) was one of the first companies to offer microinsurance and began selling policies in Uganda in 1997. Swiss Re, Munich Re, Allianz and Zurich Financial Services have also entered the microinsurance arena. Disasters such as the 2005 tsunami in Indonesia and the 2010 Haiti earthquake have demonstrated the need for insurance in many regions, prompting insurers to develop new products.

"The reinsurance business is evolving. Traditionally, reinsurance transactions were between two insurance entities: the primary insurer that sold the original insurance policies and the reinsurer. Most still are. Primary insurers and reinsurers can share both the premiums and losses or reinsurers may assume the primary company's losses above a certain dollar limit in return for a fee.

"Fortunately, insurance companies run their businesses conservatively, as if every day might bring some new disaster, so despite current economic and financial conditions, the industry has been able to function normally. Unlike banks, insurers are not highly leveraged (they generally do not borrow to make investments or to pay claims); they limit the amount of risk they assume to the capital they have on hand; and because they do not sell the risks they assume to another party-they have some 'skin in the game'-they must underwrite carefully or suffer the consequences.","How do insurance companies mitigate financial risks, and why is this approach different from that of banks?","Insurance companies manage risk conservatively, limiting risk to available capital and maintaining a stake in the outcome, unlike highly leveraged banks.",Insurance_Handbook_20103,4.0,"The context explains how insurance companies mitigate risk (conservative business practices, limited risk assumption, and 'skin in the game'), and it highlights a key difference from banks (lower leverage).

"However, compensation levels are not uniform. In some states benefits are still inadequate, while in others, they are overly generous.

"increases insurers' ability to provide insurance protection by transferring the risk to bond investors. Commercial banks and other lenders have been securitizing mortgages for years, freeing up capital to expand their mortgage business. Insurers and reinsurers issue catastrophe bonds to the securities market through an issuer known as a special purpose reinsurance vehicle (SPRV) set up specifically for this purpose. These bonds have complicated structures and are typically created offshore where tax and regulatory treatment may be more favorable. SPRVs collect the premium from the insurance or reinsurance company and the principal from investors and hold them in a trust in the form of U.S. Treasuries or other highly rated assets, using the investment income to pay interest on the principal. Catastrophe bonds pay high interest rates but if the trigger event occurs, investors lose the interest and sometimes the principal, depending on the structure of the bond, both of which may be used to cover the insurer's disaster losses. Bonds may be issued for a one-year term or multiple years, often three.","How do catastrophe bonds work, and what are the risks and benefits for investors and insurers?","Catastrophe bonds transfer risk from insurers to investors.

Such policies compensate the business against significant losses that result from that person's death or disability. The amount and cost of insurance needed for a particular business depends on the situation and the age, health and role of the key employee. Key employee life insurance pays a death benefit to the company when the key employee dies. The policy is normally owned by the company, which pays the premiums and is the beneficiary.

"How It Works: The NFIP is administered by FEMA, now part of the Department of Homeland Security. Flood insurance was initially only available through insurance agents who dealt directly with the federal program. The 'direct' policy program has been supplemented since 1983 with a private/public cooperative arrangement, known as 'Write Your Own,' through which a pool of insurance companies issue policies and adjust flood claims on behalf of the federal government under their own names, charging the same premium as the direct program. Participating insurers receive an expense allowance for policies written and claims processed. The federal government retains responsibility for underwriting losses.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly owned companies to report their financial results using GAAP rules. Insurers outside the United States use standards that differ from SAP and GAAP. As global markets developed, the need for more uniform accounting standards became clear. In 2001 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), an independent international accounting standards setting organization, began work on a set of standards, called International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that it hopes will be used around the world.

"Why Insurers Need It: Insurers need to be able to assess the risk of loss-the possibility that a driver or a homeowner will have an accident and file a claimin order to decide whether to insure that individual and what rate to set for the coverage provided.

Where information is insufficient, applicants for insurance may be placed in the wrong risk classification.

"In the 1950s and 1960s cycles were regular, with a three-year period of soft pricing followed by a three-year period of hard pricing in practically all lines of property/casualty insurance. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were only two cycles, one mainly affecting auto insurance in the mid-1970s and the other in the mid-1980s, affecting commercial liability insurance. The commercial liability insurance cycle gave rise to the 'liability crisis,' when certain types of commercial liability coverages, such as insurance for daycare centers, municipalities, ski resorts and any establishment selling liquor, became difficult to obtain. Since that time, with the exception of the difficulty in obtaining medical malpractice insurance in the early part of the last decade, the insurance cycle has had less of an impact on the public.","How did the patterns of property/casualty insurance pricing cycles change between the 1950s-1960s and the 1970s-1980s, and what crisis emerged as a result?","In the 1950s-60s, insurance pricing followed regular three-year cycles of soft and hard pricing.

If insurers set rates too high they will lose market share to competitors who have more accurately matched rates to expected costs. If they set rates too low they will lose money. This continuous search for accuracy is good for consumers as well as insurance companies. The majority of consumers benefit because they are not subsidizing people who are worse insurance risks-people who are more likely to file claims than they are.,"What is the primary goal of insurance companies regarding policy rates, and what are the consequences of setting rates too high or too low?","The primary goal is to closely correlate rates with the actual cost of claims.

"The first of the residual market mechanisms for automobile coverage was established in New Hampshire in 1938. As states began to pass laws requiring drivers to furnish proof of insurance, having auto liability insurance became a prerequisite for driving a car. Today, all 50 states and the District of Columbia use one of four systems to guarantee that auto insurance is available to those who need it. All four systems are commonly known as assigned risk plans, although the term technically applies only to the first type of plan, where each insurer is required to assume its share of residual market policyholders or 'risks.'

"Another criticism of the NFIP is that it does not charge enough for coverage. Among the reasons for the premium shortfall is that the cost of coverage on dwellings that were built before floodplain management regulations were established in their communities is subsidized. As a result, the premiums paid for flood coverage by the owners of these properties reflect only 30 to 40 percent of the true risk of loss. In January 2006 FEMA estimated an annual shortfall in premium income of $750 million due to these subsidies. Some subsidized properties also suffer repetitive losses. Repetitive loss properties accounted for about $4.6 billion in claims payments between 1978 and 2004.

"FAIR Plans: Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia currently have property insurance plans known as FAIR, an acronym for Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plans. The concept of FAIR Plans was established following passage by Congress of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, a measure designed to address the conditions that led to the 1967 urban riots. This legislation made federal riot reinsurance available to those states that instituted such property insurance pools. One of the plans, Arkansas' Rural Risk Plan, was created in 1988 to provide a market for property insurance in rural areas where fire protection is poor or nonexistent. Mississippi's Rural Plan, which offered fire, extended coverage and vandalism, see below, was expanded to cover the entire state in 2003.

"Homeowners insurance provides financial protection against disasters. It is a package policy, which means that it covers both damage to property and liability, or legal responsibility, for any injuries and property damage policyholders or their families cause to other people. This includes damage caused by household pets. Damage caused by most disasters is covered but there are exceptions. Standard homeowners policies do not cover flooding, earthquakes or poor maintenance. Flood coverage, however, is available in the form of a separate policy both from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and from a few private insurers.

"Reinsurance for catastrophic losses. The insurance industry is able to absorb the multibillion dollar losses caused by natural and man-made disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and terrorist attacks because losses are spread among thousands of companies including catastrophe reinsurers who operate on a global basis. Insurers' ability and willingness to sell insurance fluctuates with the availability and cost of catastrophe reinsurance. After major disasters, such as Hurricane Andrew and the World Trade Center terrorist attack, the availability of catastrophe reinsurance becomes extremely limited. Claims deplete reinsurers' capital and, as a result, companies are more selective in the type and amount of risks they assume. In addition, with available supply limited, prices for reinsurance rise. This contributes to an overall increase in prices for property insurance.","How does the availability and cost of catastrophe reinsurance affect insurers' ability and willingness to sell insurance, and what happens after major disasters?","Insurers' ability and willingness to sell insurance fluctuates with the availability and cost of catastrophe reinsurance.

"When agents or company representatives are unable to obtain auto insurance for an applicant in the voluntary market, they submit the application to the assigned risk plan office. These applications are distributed randomly by the automobile insurance plan to all insurance companies that offer automobile liability coverage in the state in proportion to the amount of their voluntary business. Thus, if on a given day the plan receives 100 applications from agents around the state, a company with 10 percent of that state's regular private passenger automobile insurance business will be assigned 10 of those applicants and will be responsible for all associated losses.",How are auto insurance applications handled when agents cannot find coverage in the voluntary market?,"They're submitted to the assigned risk plan office, distributed proportionally among insurers based on their market share, and the assigned company is responsible for associated losses.",Insurance_Handbook_20103,5.0,"The context clearly explains the process for handling auto insurance applications when coverage cannot be found in the voluntary market.

"The move to modernize insurance regulation is being driven in part by the globalization of insurance services. Some large U.S. companies that operate in other countries support the concept of a federal system that provides one-stop regulatory approval while others believe the merits of a state system outweigh the virtues of a single national regulator. As a result of discussions about the merits of each system, states are making it easier for insurers to respond quickly to market forces. Since 2009, various pieces of legislation have been introduced in Congress that respond to a number of concerns: lack of an entity at the federal level that can represent insurance interests, particularly in the discussion of international issues; the need for better oversight of systemic risk-the interconnectedness of the risk assumed by a few large financial services companies whose failure could bring down the entire financial system; and the need to streamline the regulation of reinsurers and surplus lines insurers.",What are some of the arguments for and against a federal system of insurance regulation in the US?,"Arguments for a federal system include one-stop regulatory approval, facilitating responses to market forces.

"As the name implies, an umbrella liability policy provides coverage over and above a business's other liability coverages. It is designed to protect against unusually high losses, providing protection when the policy limits of one of the underlying policies have been used up. For a typical business, an umbrella policy would provide protection beyond Its general liability and auto liability policies. If a company has employment practices liability insurance, directors and officers liability, or other types of liability insurance, the umbrella could provide protection beyond those policy limits as well.

"Captives may be established to provide insurance to more than one entity. An association or group of companies may band together to form a captive to provide insurance coverage. Professionals-doctors, lawyers, accountants-have formed many captives over the years. Captives may, in turn, use a variety of reinsurance mechanisms to provide the coverage. In particular, many offshore captives use a 'fronting' insurer to provide the basic insurance policy. Fronting typically means that underwriting, claims and administrative functions are handled in the United States by an experienced commercial insurance company, since a captive generally will not want to get involved directly in running the insurance operation. Also, fronting allows a company to show it has an insur-","What is a common practice used by offshore captives to provide insurance coverage, and why is this practice employed?","Many offshore captives use a 'fronting' insurer to handle underwriting, claims, and administration.

"The tendency of those exposed to a higher risk to seek more insurance coverage than those at a lower risk.
